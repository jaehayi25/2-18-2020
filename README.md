A birthday gift made with Unity to practice player movement, camera control, switching scenes, object collision, pushing and pulling objects, platforming, and C#. 

I learned basic unity skills by using online material: 
- platform, jumping, player controls: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGDeafTx5ug
- pushing and pulling blocks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz2qMxmtxpQ&t=230s
- switching scenes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26d1uZ7yrfY&t=1s
